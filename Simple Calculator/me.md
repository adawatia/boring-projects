# Simple Calculator Program

## Description

This is a simple Python calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator, then returns the result of the operation.

## Features

- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Rounds results to 3 decimal places.
- Prevents division by zero and returns an error message if attempted.
- Handles invalid input for both the operator and the numbers.
  
## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a valid operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Enter two numbers for the operation.
4. The result of the operation will be displayed, rounded to 3 decimal places.

### Example

```bash
$ python calculator.py
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the 1st number: 12
Enter the 2nd number: 3
12.0 + 3.0 = 15.0
